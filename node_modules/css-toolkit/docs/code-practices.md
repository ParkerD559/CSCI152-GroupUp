# Code Practices of CSS Toolkit

Standards for developing flexible, accessible, and long-term maintainability of
HTML and CSS.

1. Code to Standard.
2. Delete Dead Code.

## Classes

* Semantic.
* Classes for meaning, not for show.

## Relativity

* Media queries, adapt to screen size use: em.
* Block sizing - use: percents.
* Viewport sizing - viewport units: vw, vh, vmin, vmax.
* Font height, sizing - use: rems.
* Combining the the above - use: flex, min-width, max-width, etc.

## CSS

* !important to define overriding rules, not for fixups.
* Use shorthands to create a “blank slate”. Use longhands for targetted modifying only.
* Provide fallbacks / use @supports.
