# CSS Toolkit

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/css-toolkit.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/css-toolkit)

CSS Toolkit is a lightweight and scalable collection of CSS utilities. It uses an
expressive approach to writing lightweight, scalable utility classes that are easy
to write and understand.

The toolkit does not impose any theme-specific styles or UI components, so
you're free to architect your code in the way that you want.

## Quick Start

Choose one of the following options:

1. Download and add the main file of the CSS Toolkit in the header of your
   project. For example:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css-toolkit/dist/toolkit.min.css">
   ```

   Or use the [CDN Link](https://npmcdn.com/css-toolkit@0.6.6/dist/toolkit.min.css)
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://npmcdn.com/css-toolkit@0.6.6/dist/toolkit.min.css">
   ```
2. Install with [npm](http://npmjs.org/): `npm install css-toolkit` And
   build your website-specific theme styles in your build process with PostCSS.
   For example:

   ```css
   @import "css-toolkit";

   :root {
     --body-color: #fff;
     --body-bg: #333;
   }
   ```
